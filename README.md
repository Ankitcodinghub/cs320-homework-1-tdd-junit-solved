<pre>   This assignment helps you practice Test-Driven Development
(TDD). The problem you are trying to solve here is one that you
should be able to solve in a prior course on Data Structures.
However, here you need to use the TDD methodology we have
covered.
</pre>
<pre>Note that the 3 laws of TDD are:
</pre>
<pre>1. You may not write production code until you have written a
failing unit test
</pre>
<pre>2. You may not write more of a unit test than is sufficient to
fail
</pre>
<pre>3. You may not write more production code than is sufficient to
pass the currently failing test
</pre>
<pre> NOTE:: do not write the functional code in your head before you
                         write the test.
</pre>
In this assignment, you will use JUnit and Java to implement a bounded stack of size 5, namely MyStack, using an integer array. Recall the three basic operations of a traditional stack are push, pop, and top as shown below:

<pre>2. Get Started with Basic Test
</pre>
<pre>   You should start the assignment by creating a JUnit test class
and name it ‚ÄúBasicTest‚Äù. This class is for testing/implementing
basic operations of a bounded stack. Note that the data
structure you should use is array. The following test cases are
required, although you do not have to follow the exact order
when you implement them. Also, you can have more test cases than
what are listed here.
</pre>
<pre>1. Create a MyStack and verify that IsEmpty is true.
</pre>
<pre>2. Push a number on the MyStack and verify that IsEmpty is
false.
</pre>
<pre>3. Push a number, Pop the number, and verify that IsEmpty is
true.
</pre>
<pre>4. Push a number, remember what it is; Pop the number, and
verify that the two numbers are equal.
</pre>
<pre>5. Push three numbers, remember what they are; Pop each one, and
verify that they are removed in the correct order.
</pre>
<pre>6. Pop a MyStack that has no elements.
</pre>
<pre>7. Push a number and then call Top. Verify that IsEmpty is
false.
</pre>
<pre>8. Push a number, remember what it is; and then call Top. Verify
that the number that is returned is the same as the one that was
pushed.

When you implement these tests the MyStack class should also be implemented along the way. To indicate the order in which you implement the tests and features label each method (in both test and functional code) using STEP 1, STEP 2, etc, and include a short description about the method. Listing 1 shows a sample based on the class demo.

<pre>In addition, you should also document your refactor activities
in a text file refactor.txt. Each line of this file should look
like the following:
</pre>
<pre>Refactor after STEP 2: ‚Äúdescription of changes.‚Äù
</pre>
<pre>Note that you do not have to do refactor in every single ‚Äúred-
green-refactor" cycle, but for the ones that you do improve you
should document the improvement in this file.

<pre>3. Advanced Test
</pre>
<pre>Now that you have already finished implementing a bounded stack
using TDD, you can write more tests for some special cases:
</pre>
<pre>1. Call Top on a MyStack with no elements.
</pre>
<pre>2. Push a number to a MyStack that is full (hint: you may throw
an exception here).
</pre>
<pre>3. A self-defined, new test case (it can be anything, e.g.,
performance test).
</pre>
<pre>4. Aggregating Tests in Suite
</pre>
<pre>Now that you have two test classes, let‚Äôs combine them and make
a test suite. When you run this test suite all test cases in
both classes should be executed automatically (hint: to do this,
you need to use the @RunWith annotation as seen in Step 9 of the
JUnit guide and demo code).
</pre>
<pre>5. Submission
</pre>
<pre>This assignment is due at 11:59pm on 9/11/2020. Late submissions
are subject to a 20% penalty. Late submissions will not be
accepted after 3 days past the deadline (11:59pm on 9/14).
</pre>
<pre>Submit the following files as a package to Blackboard:
1. BasicTest.java
2. AdvancedTest.java
3. TestSuite.java
</pre>
<pre>4. MyStack.java
5. refactor.txt
